# Build your own A.I. powered robot
With the rise of new rapidly evolving interfaces and an explosion in intelligence services the need to jump on this track is more relevant than ever. With the commodity of hardware and the computing power of Azure Cloud, Artificial Intelligence is at our fingertips and waiting to be implemented in new innovative solutions. 

In this workshop, we give you a quick start in this new world and introduce you to Windows IoT, micro controllers with some sensors and the power of Microsoft Cognitive Services. 

You are going to make a chatbot, not a boring one in a browser that can order airplane tickets for you, but a real robot that can talk to you and uses its vision and voice to interact with its surroundings.

## What should you expect
We are going to build a real bot powered by Microsoft Cognitive Services. The bot will run on a Raspberry PI powered by Windows IoT. Your bot will be able to see, hear and talk back to you.   

**Topics covered in this workshop:**
- Windows IoT Core
- Raspberry PI and some sensors
- Cognitive Services (Like: Face API / Custom Vision / Language Understanding)

## What to bring:
Just bring your laptop running Windows with Visual Studio 2017. You will need an Azure subscription to activate the Cognitive Services APIs, if you donâ€™t have one please create one before the workshop. If you have your own Raspberry and USB camera, please bring them, if not you can borrow one from us.

### Bring a laptop running:
- Windows 10 - Version	10.0.17134 Build 17134 (with Administrator access)
- Visual Studio 2017 -  (version 15.7.4) (with workloads: Universal Windows Platform development / Azure development)
- Latest UWP SDK (1803) [Installer](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk?WT.mc_id=aiml-0000-heboelma)
- Intall the Windows IOT Core Dashboard [Download](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=708576&WT.mc_id=aiml-0000-heboelma)

### Bring
 - An Azure Subscription. [You can create on here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=aiml-0000-heboelma).
 - Some C# Knowledge *(it is not a copy / paste workshop)*
 - Headphones (with a mini jack)
 
### Enable development mode 
 - Open: settings
 - Open: Update & Security
 - Open: For Developers
 - Select: "Developer Mode" under "Use developer features"

### Note:
 - A remote desktop in Azure will **not work** as you need to access the local network
 - Most of the things will work on the MAC running Windows 10 in like a Virtual Box 

## Limited space
We have 20 hardware kits that can be used during the training, ofcourse you can share and work together.
